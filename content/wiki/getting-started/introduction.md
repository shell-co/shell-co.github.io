## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is to use the search bar at the top and type in what some common terms related to a challege. For example if you are solving a crypto challenge and notice that it involves prime numbers you should type in `prime` and see if there is anything related.

You can also check out the side bar and see if any of the titles under the relevant section fit your need.
